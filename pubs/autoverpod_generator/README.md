# AutoVerpod Generator

A code generator for the [autoverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/autoverpod) package that automatically generates Riverpod-integrated widgets based on annotations.

## Features

- Generates stateless widgets with Riverpod integration from `@stateWidget` annotations
- Generates form widgets with Riverpod integration from `@formWidget` annotations
- Generates form update widgets with Riverpod integration from `@formUpdateWidget` annotations
- Provides an extensible architecture for adding custom generators

## Installation

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  autoverpod: ^0.0.3

dev_dependencies:
  autoverpod_generator: ^0.0.1
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
```

## Usage

The autoverpod_generator works in conjunction with the autoverpod package to generate Riverpod-integrated widgets from annotated classes. It processes annotations like `@stateWidget`, `@formWidget`, and `@formUpdateWidget` to create the necessary boilerplate code for your Flutter application.

After adding the appropriate annotations to your classes, run the build_runner to generate the widgets:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

## Additional Information

For more detailed information about how to use the generated widgets and the full capabilities of the autoverpod ecosystem, please refer to the [autoverpod package documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/autoverpod).
