// Example of using autoverpod package

import 'package:autoverpod/autoverpod.dart';

// Example of using the annotations
void main() {
  print('Autoverpod Example');

  // The annotations are meant to be used with code generators
  // Here's how you would use them in your code:

  // @formWidget
  // class UserForm { ... }

  // @stateWidget
  // class UserProfile { ... }

  print('See the comments for usage examples');
}

// In a real application, you would use these annotations with Flutter widgets
// and a code generator would process them to create the necessary boilerplate code.
